# A. Overview

SuperST is a novel algorithm that employs a deep image prior (_i.e._, Unet) to create dense matrices from low-resolution Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) libraries. The details of how SuperST is run are explained in this repository and are also discussed in our paper. Briefly, SuperST is composed of five units, that said A, B, C, D, and E, which indicate an input H&E image, conceptual down-sampling unit, _‘concatenate’_, conceptual up-sampling unit, and _‘conv2d_25’_, respectively.

Looking forward, SuperST holds the potential to be utilized across various research domains that employ ST in imaging analysis workflows. Also, SuperST-produced image data could be effortlessly integrated with other spatial omics technologies. Overall, SuperST marks a significant stride forward in the realm of Spatial Transcriptomics, paving the way for a deeper understanding of intricate biological systems.
